    const goodFakeArticle = "Jeffrey K. Uhlmann is an American research scientist who is probably best known for his mathematical generalizations of the Kalman filter.[1] Most of his publications and patents have been in the field of data fusion. He is also known for being a cult filmmaker and former recording artist. Dr. Uhlmann is ranked in the top 2% among scientists worldwide in the Stanford University listing of most-cited researchers.[2] Biography Uhlmann has degrees in philosophy, computer science, and a doctorate in robotics from the University of Oxford.[3][4] He began work in 1987 at NRL's Laboratory for Computational Physics and Fluid Dynamics in Washington, DC, and remained at NRL until 2000. Since 2000 he has been a professor of computer science at the University of Missouri.[5] He served for ten years as a co-founding member of the editorial board of the ACM Journal of Experimental Algorithmics (1995â€“2006) before becoming co-editor of the Synthesis Lectures on Quantum Computing series for Morgan & Claypool.[6] Theoretical Research Uhlmann published seminal papers on volumetric, spatial, and metric tree data structures and their applications for computer graphics, virtual reality, and multiple-target tracking.[7][8][9] He originated the unscented transform (and its use in the unscented Kalman filter) and the data fusion techniques of covariance intersection and covariance union.[1][3] His work in artificial intelligence has recently focused on tensor-completion methods for recommender system applications.[10] Applied Results Uhlmann's results are widely-applied in tracking, navigation, and control systems, including for the NASA Mars rover program.[11][12] His results relating to the constrained shortest path problem and simultaneous localization and mapping are also used in rover and autonomous vehicle applications.[13][14] Films Uhlmann has written, directed, produced, and/or acted in several prominent short and feature-length films. Notable examples include the animated short film Susan's Big Day[15] and the feature films Mil Mascaras vs. the Aztec Mummy, Academy of Doom, and Aztec Revenge. In recent years he has been a popular invited guest at international genre film festivals.[16] Music Uhlmann recorded and released a series of albums in the 1970s and 1980s. Some of his early experimental electronic albums have been reissued in their entirety on CD[17] or digital download[18] while his arguably better-known songs are only available on CD compilations.[19]"
